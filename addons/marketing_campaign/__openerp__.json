The process is as follows:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    * Design marketing campaigns like workflows, including email templates to\n      send, reports to print and send by email, custom actions\n    * Define input segments that will select the items that should enter the\n      campaign (e.g leads from certain countries.)\n    * Run your campaign in simulation mode to test it real-time or accelerated,\n      and fine-tune it\n    * You may also start the real campaign in manual mode, where each action\n      requires manual validation\n    * Finally launch your campaign live, and watch the statistics as the\n      campaign does everything fully automatically.\n\nWhile the campaign runs you can of course continue to fine-tune the parameters,\ninput segments, workflow.\n\n**Note:** If you need demo data, you can install the marketing_campaign_crm_demo\n      module, but this will also install the CRM application as it depends on\n      CRM Leads.\n    ", "sequence": 100, "demo": ["marketing_campaign_demo.xml"], "depends": ["marketing", "document", "email_template", "decimal_precision"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["marketing_campaign_view.xml", "marketing_campaign_data.xml", "marketing_campaign_workflow.xml", "report/campaign_analysis_view.xml", "security/marketing_campaign_security.xml", "security/ir.model.access.csv"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Marketing", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Marketing Campaigns", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.1", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/marketing_campaign.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/marketing_campaign", "installable": true}
