Otherwise, the\nnew task will not belong to any project, and may be added to a project manually\nlater.\n\nWhen the project task is completed or cancelled, the corresponding procurement\nis updated accordingly. For example, if this procurement corresponds to a sale\norder line, the sale order line will be considered delivered when the task is\ncompleted.\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": ["demo/sale_service_demo.xml"], "depends": ["project", "procurement", "sale", "procurement_jit"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["views/sale_service_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Project Management", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Create Tasks on SO", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.0", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/project_task_procurement.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/sale_service", "installable": true}
