Each list of record can also be switched to a graphical \nview of it.\n\nThree reports are available:\n----------------------------\n    1. The first is available from a list of Budgets. It gives the spreading, for \n       these Budgets, of the Analytic Accounts.\n\n    2. The second is a summary of the previous one, it only gives the spreading, \n       for the selected Budgets, of the Analytic Accounts.\n\n    3. The last one is available from the Analytic Chart of Accounts. It gives \n       the spreading, for the selected Analytic Accounts of Budgets.\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": ["account_budget_demo.xml"], "depends": ["account"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["security/ir.model.access.csv", "security/account_budget_security.xml", "account_budget_view.xml", "account_budget_report.xml", "account_budget_workflow.xml", "wizard/account_budget_analytic_view.xml", "wizard/account_budget_report_view.xml", "wizard/account_budget_crossovered_summary_report_view.xml", "wizard/account_budget_crossovered_report_view.xml", "views/report_analyticaccountbudget.xml", "views/report_budget.xml", "views/report_crossoveredbudget.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Accounting & Finance", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Budgets Management", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.0", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/account_budget.yml", "test/account_budget_report.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/account_budget", "installable": true}
