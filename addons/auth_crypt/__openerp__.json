It is thus recommended to enable\nsome password reset mechanism for users, such as the one provided\nby the ``auth_signup`` module (signup for new users does not\nnecessarily have to be enabled).\n\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["base"], "auto_install": true, "data": [], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Tools", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Password Encryption", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": ["OpenERP SA", "FS3"], "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.2.0", "post_load": null, "test": [], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/auth_crypt", "installable": true}
