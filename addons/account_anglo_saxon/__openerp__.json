Anglo-Saxons accounting does \ntake the cost when sales invoice is created, Continental accounting will \ntake the cost at the moment the goods are shipped.\n\nThis module will add this functionality by using a interim account, to \nstore the value of shipped goods and will contra book this interim \naccount when the invoice is created to transfer this amount to the \ndebtor or creditor account. Secondly, price differences between actual \npurchase price and fixed product standard price are booked on a separate \naccount.", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["product", "purchase"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["product_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Accounting & Finance", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Anglo-Saxon Accounting", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA, Veritos", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.2", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/anglo_saxon.yml", "test/anglo_saxon_avg_fifo.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/account_anglo_saxon", "installable": true}
