It can automatically send reminders, escalate the request, trigger specific methods and many other actions based on your own enterprise rules.\n\nThe greatest thing about this system is that users don't need to do anything special. The CRM module has an email gateway for the synchronization interface between mails and OpenERP. That way, users can just send emails to the request tracker.\n\nOpenERP will take care of thanking them for their message, automatically routing it to the appropriate staff and make sure all future correspondence gets to the right place.\n\n\nDashboard for CRM will include:\n-------------------------------\n* Planned Revenue by Stage and User (graph)\n* Opportunities by Stage (graph)\n", "sequence": 2, "demo": ["crm_demo.xml", "crm_lead_demo.xml", "crm_phonecall_demo.xml", "crm_action_rule_demo.xml"], "depends": ["base_action_rule", "base_setup", "sales_team", "mail", "email_template", "calendar", "resource", "board", "fetchmail"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["crm_data.xml", "crm_lead_data.xml", "crm_phonecall_data.xml", "security/crm_security.xml", "security/ir.model.access.csv", "wizard/crm_lead_to_opportunity_view.xml", "wizard/crm_phonecall_to_phonecall_view.xml", "wizard/crm_merge_opportunities_view.xml", "crm_view.xml", "crm_phonecall_view.xml", "crm_phonecall_menu.xml", "crm_lead_view.xml", "crm_lead_menu.xml", "calendar_event_menu.xml", "report/crm_lead_report_view.xml", "report/crm_opportunity_report_view.xml", "report/crm_phonecall_report_view.xml", "res_partner_view.xml", "res_config_view.xml", "base_partner_merge_view.xml", "sales_team_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/crm/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Customer Relationship Management", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "CRM", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "Leads, Opportunities, Phone Calls", "application": true, "version": "8.0.1.0", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/crm_access_group_users.yml", "test/crm_lead_message.yml", "test/lead2opportunity2win.yml", "test/lead2opportunity_assign_salesmen.yml", "test/crm_lead_merge.yml", "test/crm_lead_cancel.yml", "test/segmentation.yml", "test/phonecalls.yml", "test/crm_lead_onchange.yml", "test/crm_lead_copy.yml", "test/crm_lead_unlink.yml", "test/crm_lead_find_stage.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/crm", "installable": true}
