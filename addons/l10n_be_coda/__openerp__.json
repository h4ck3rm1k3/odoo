Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of\nthe CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the\ncreation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a\n'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original\nCODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting\nbusiness processes.\n\nCODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.\n\nA removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the\nassociated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank\nStatements will also remove those associated statements.\n\nInstead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also\nre-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that\nwas missing to allow automatic reconciliation.\n\nRemark on CODA V1 support:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured\ncommunication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The\ndescription provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA\nV2.2 specifications.\nIf required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": ["l10n_be_coda_demo.xml"], "depends": ["account_voucher", "base_iban", "l10n_be_invoice_bba"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["l10n_be_coda_wizard.xml", "l10n_be_coda_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Accounting & Finance", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Belgium - Import Bank CODA Statements", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "Noviat", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.2.1", "post_load": null, "test": [], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/l10n_be_coda", "installable": true}
