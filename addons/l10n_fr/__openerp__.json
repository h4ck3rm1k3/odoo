{"website": "http://www.openerp.com", "description": "\nThis is the module to manage the accounting chart for France in OpenERP.\n========================================================================\n\nThis module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to\ncompanies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, R\u00e9union, Mayotte).\n\nThis localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases\n(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these\n'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this\nmodule (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'\nscenarios in fiscal positions).\n\nThis localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland\ncompany sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the\nfiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes\nand 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default\nin l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the\nconfiguration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.\n\n**Credits:** Sistheo, Zeekom, CrysaLEAD, Akretion and Camptocamp.\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["base_iban", "account", "account_chart", "base_vat"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["views/report_l10nfrbilan.xml", "views/report_l10nfrresultat.xml", "l10n_fr_reports.xml", "fr_report.xml", "plan_comptable_general.xml", "l10n_fr_view.xml", "l10n_fr_wizard.xml", "fr_pcg_taxes.xml", "fr_tax.xml", "fr_fiscal_templates.xml", "security/ir.model.access.csv", "wizard/fr_report_bilan_view.xml", "wizard/fr_report_compute_resultant_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/l10n_fr/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Localization/Account Charts", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "France - Accounting", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.1", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/l10n_fr_report.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/l10n_fr", "installable": true}
