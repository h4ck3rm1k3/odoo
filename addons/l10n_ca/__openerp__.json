However this customer comes to your location\nwith their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.\n\n3) An international supplier doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs \nby the customs broker. On the supplier, set the fiscal position to International.\n\n4) An international supplier charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your\nprovincial government and remit taxes themselves. On the supplier, do not set any fiscal \nposition.\n    ", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["base", "account", "base_iban", "base_vat", "account_chart", "account_anglo_saxon"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["account_chart_en.xml", "account_tax_code_en.xml", "account_chart_template_en.xml", "account_tax_en.xml", "fiscal_templates_en.xml", "account_chart_fr.xml", "account_tax_code_fr.xml", "account_chart_template_fr.xml", "account_tax_fr.xml", "fiscal_templates_fr.xml", "l10n_ca_wizard.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/l10n_ca/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Localization/Account Charts", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Canada - Accounting", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "Savoir-faire Linux", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.2", "post_load": null, "test": [], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/l10n_ca", "installable": true}
