{"website": "http://openerpbrasil.org", "description": "\nBase module for the Brazilian localization\n==========================================\n\nThis module consists in:\n\n - Generic Brazilian chart of accounts\n - Brazilian taxes such as:\n\n        - IPI\n        - ICMS\n        - PIS\n        - COFINS\n        - ISS\n        - IR\n        - IRPJ\n        - CSLL\n\nThe field tax_discount has also been added in the account.tax.template and \naccount.tax objects to allow the proper computation of some Brazilian VATs \nsuch as ICMS. The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to \npropagate those new data properly.\n\nIt's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to \nuse OpenERP properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic \nfiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 \nadditional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project \nhttps://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the \nextra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable \nOpenERP modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the \nreasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization \nleaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies \nfund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, \naccounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September \n2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't \ncome with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.\n", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["account", "account_chart"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["data/account.account.type.csv", "data/account.account.template.csv", "data/account_tax_code_template.xml", "data/account_chart_template.xml", "data/account_tax_template.xml", "account_view.xml", "l10n_br_wizard.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/l10n_br/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Localization/Account Charts", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Brazilian - Accounting", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "Akretion, OpenERP Brasil", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.0.6", "post_load": null, "test": [], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/l10n_br", "installable": true}
