Procurements represent needs that need to be solved by a procurement\nrule.  When a procurement is created, it is confirmed.  When a rule is found,\nit will be put in running state.  After, it will check if what needed to be done\nfor the rule has been executed.  Then it will go to the done state.  A procurement\ncan also go into exception, for example when it can not find a rule and it can be cancelled.\n\nThe mechanism will be extended by several modules.  The procurement rule of stock will\ncreate a move and the procurement will be fulfilled when the move is done.\nThe procurement rule of sale_service will create a task.  Those of purchase or\nmrp will create a purchase order or a manufacturing order.\n\nThe scheduler will check if it can assign a rule to confirmed procurements and if\nit can put running procurements to done.\n\nProcurements in exception should be checked manually and can be re-run.\n    ", "sequence": 100, "demo": [], "depends": ["base", "product"], "auto_install": true, "data": ["security/ir.model.access.csv", "security/procurement_security.xml", "procurement_data.xml", "wizard/schedulers_all_view.xml", "procurement_view.xml", "company_view.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Hidden/Dependency", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Procurements", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.0", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/procurement.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/procurement", "installable": true}
