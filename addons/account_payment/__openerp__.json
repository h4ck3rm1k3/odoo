The booking of \nyour order must be encoded as usual through a bank statement. Indeed, it's only \nwhen you get the confirmation from your bank that your order has been accepted \nthat you can book it in your accounting. To help you with that operation, you \nhave a new option to import payment orders as bank statement lines.\n    ", "sequence": 100, "demo": ["account_payment_demo.xml"], "depends": ["account", "account_voucher"], "auto_install": false, "data": ["security/account_payment_security.xml", "security/ir.model.access.csv", "wizard/account_payment_pay_view.xml", "wizard/account_payment_populate_statement_view.xml", "wizard/account_payment_create_order_view.xml", "account_payment_view.xml", "account_payment_workflow.xml", "account_payment_sequence.xml", "account_payment_report.xml", "views/report_paymentorder.xml"], "demo_xml": [], "icon": "/base/static/description/icon.png", "category": "Accounting & Finance", "web": false, "init_xml": [], "name": "Suppliers Payment Management", "license": "AGPL-3", "author": "OpenERP SA", "update_xml": [], "summary": "", "application": false, "version": "8.0.1.1", "post_load": null, "test": ["test/account_payment_demo.yml", "test/cancel_payment_order.yml", "test/payment_order_process.yml", "test/account_payment_report.yml"], "module_path": "/mnt/data/home/mdupont/experiments/odoo/addons/account_payment", "installable": true}
